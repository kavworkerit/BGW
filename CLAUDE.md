# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be a new or empty project directory. There are currently no source files, configuration files, or documentation present.

## Initial Setup

Since this is an empty project, you'll need to determine:

1. What type of project this will be (web app, mobile app, API, etc.)
2. What programming language/framework to use
3. What build tools and package managers are needed
4. What the overall architecture will be

## Next Steps

When working in this repository, you should:

1. Ask the user about their project requirements and preferences
2. Suggest an appropriate project structure based on their needs
3. Set up initial configuration files as needed
4. Create a basic project scaffolding

## Development Workflow

Since no build system or tools are currently configured, the development workflow will be established based on the chosen technology stack once the project direction is determined.
